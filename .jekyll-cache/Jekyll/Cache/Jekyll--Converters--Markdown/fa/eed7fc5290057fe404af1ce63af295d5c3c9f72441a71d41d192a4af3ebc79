I"¼<p>We found these during Happy Hour at Chisoâ€™s Grill in Bee Cave, Tx. Weâ€™ve since tweaked the recipe a bit. This recipe is just a starting point, add/remove anything you want (like more hot sauce if youâ€™re into that). Sometimes I order the <a href="https://amzn.to/2MGUnam">peppers on Amazon</a>. My favorite hot sauces are Franks Red Hot, Jardineâ€™s Texas Champagne, and of course, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pw4LAv">Yellowbird</a>.</p>
