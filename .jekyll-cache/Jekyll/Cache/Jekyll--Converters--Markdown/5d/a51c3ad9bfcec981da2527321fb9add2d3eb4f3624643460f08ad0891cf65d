I"¸<p>We found these during Happy Hour at Chisoâ€™s Grill in Bee Cave, Tx. Weâ€™ve since tweaked the recipe a bit. This recipe is just a starting point, add/remove anything you want (like more hot sauce if youâ€™re into that). Sometimes I order the <a href="https://amzn.to/2MGUnam">peppers on Amazon</a>. My favorite hot sauces are Franks Red Hot, Jardineâ€™s Texas Champagne, and of course, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pw4LAv">Yellowbird</a>.</p>

<p>Fun fact: Peppedew Peppers are basically a new thing. They are the brand name of piquante peppers, which were discovered in South Africe in just 1993. Hat tip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppadew">Wikipedia</a> for the schooling.</p>
