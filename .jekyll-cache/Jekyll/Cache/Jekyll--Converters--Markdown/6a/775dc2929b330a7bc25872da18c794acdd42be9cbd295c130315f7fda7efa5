I"v	<p>After a few years on the backburner, we’re finally moving Chowdown up to a low simmer. We’re back with a slew of updates like HTTPS, live search, our first pull request, and this blog!</p>

<p>A quick runthough the new goodness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTTPS for <a href="https://chowdown.io">chowdown.io</a> is now enabled by default, thanks to recent changes by Github Pages. If you’re hosting with Github, enabling it for your own site is as simple as using the correct A/CNAME/DNS records.</li>
  <li>A simple live search is now available at <a href="/search">/search</a>. It indexes the recipe title and the ingredients (so you could find stuffed peppers by searching either “pepper” or “goat cheese”).</li>
  <li>This may seem ordinary elsewhere, but I wanted to take a quick minute to celebrate Chowdown’s first pull request. We’ve had a few forks and comments over the years, but I wasn’t really watching the project like I should, and now that we’re back on track, it’s time to celebrate 🎉🙌. You can see it <a href="https://github.com/clarklab/chowdown/pull/8">here</a>, where <a href="https://github.com/maartenpaauw">@maartenpaauw</a> submitted a little fix that enabled component recipes to have ingredients of their own. Nice!</li>
  <li>A new readme is up in the root of the repo, (read it <a href="https://github.com/clarklab/chowdown">here</a>). Moving forward, I’ll keep updating it and plan to keep an eye on the beginner use-case (which is me, I’m still new to Jekyll).</li>
  <li>Changed the default typeface to <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter UI</a>, from Rasmus Andersson. Previously we were using <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla">Karla</a>.</li>
  <li>Last but not least, I’ve added a simple blog template (this one!). That means I’ll be posting some updates here on <a href="https://chowdown.io">chowdown.io</a>, but also that you can use the blogging template in your own install (if you’re into that).</li>
</ul>

<p>New features hopefully coming in the next few weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reworked templates, including some design tweaks and a swap to the latest version of BassCSS.</li>
  <li>PWA stuffs, like more “add to homescreen” and offline caching.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll try to post some updates on new projects soon, and I’m always looking for feedback (and recipes! submit via pull request!). Until then, happy cooking!</p>
