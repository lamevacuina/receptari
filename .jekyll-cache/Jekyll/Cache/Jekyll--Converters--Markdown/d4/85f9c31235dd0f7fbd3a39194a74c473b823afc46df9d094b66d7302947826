I"ò<p>Just a quick note to say Iâ€™ve started work on the overhaul of the front-end templates. You can follow along at <a href="https://chowdown.io/beta">https://chowdown.io/beta</a>. Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mobile First.</strong> In fact, maybe donâ€™t check it on desktop yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Tabbed View.</strong> New bottom nav for easier jumping.</li>
  <li><strong>Books.</strong> Aka cookbooks aka collections aka groups are coming soon.</li>
  <li><strong>Live Search.</strong> Itâ€™s been working, now itâ€™s being featured.</li>
  <li><strong>Blog</strong>. Same. Weâ€™ve had one, now it has a home.</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve got a handful of other things coming soon, excited to share with yâ€™all. Until then, happy cooking!</p>
